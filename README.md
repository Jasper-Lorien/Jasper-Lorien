## 🎨 Jasper Lorien — Creative Systems Analyst | Studio Founder | Data Explorer 🧭

Hi! I'm Jasper Lorien, founder of **JLorien Studios**, where I blend data, logic, and imagination to solve problems that matter.

From poetic algorithms to structured chaos, I’m building skills in:

- 📊 **Data Analysis** — Python, Pandas, CSV wrangling, and real-world pattern discovery  
- 🧪 **Custom Tools** — lightweight developer utilities and game data organization  
- 🎮 **Game Systems & Procedural Design** — memory-driven worldbuilding frameworks  
- 📜 **Readable Reports & Storytelling Dashboards** — because the story behind the numbers is what matters  

I believe clean code is beautiful — but **clear meaning is essential**.  
Let’s build things that *make sense* and *make a difference*.
